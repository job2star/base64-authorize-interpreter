# Base64 Authorize Interpreter

A decentralized authorization system utilizing Base64 encoding and Clarity smart contracts to provide secure, flexible access control mechanisms.

## Overview

Base64 Authorize Interpreter is a novel blockchain-based authorization framework built on the Stacks blockchain, offering a robust and flexible approach to decentralized access management using Base64 encoding techniques.

## Core Components

The system consists of four primary smart contracts:

### Base64 Authorization (`base64-authorization`)
- Implements Base64 encoding and decoding mechanisms
- Provides cryptographic authorization primitives
- Supports token-based and signature-based authentication
- Enables secure, flexible access control strategies

### Access Control (`access-control`)
- Manages role-based and attribute-based access control
- Handles permission granularity and delegation
- Supports dynamic access policy configurations
- Implements secure principal management

### Token Gateway (`token-gateway`)
- Manages authorization tokens and credentials
- Supports multi-factor and time-bound access tokens
- Enables token minting, burning, and transfer
- Provides token lifecycle management

### Auth Interpreter (`auth-interpreter`)
- Interprets and validates complex authorization rules
- Supports context-aware access decisions
- Implements advanced verification logic
- Provides extensible authorization middleware

## Smart Contract Details

### User Registry

The user registry contract manages user accounts and profile information, serving as the foundation for identity in the ecosystem.

#### Key Functions:
```clarity
(define-public (register-user (username (string-utf8 50)) (region (string-utf8 30)) 
               (sustainability-goal (string-utf8 200)) (privacy-setting uint)))
(define-public (update-profile (username (string-utf8 50)) (region (string-utf8 30))
               (sustainability-goal (string-utf8 200))))
(define-public (update-privacy-setting (privacy-setting uint)))
```

### Carbon Tracker

This contract enables users to track their carbon footprint through various activities and calculates environmental impact.

#### Activity Types:
- Transport: Car, Bus, Train, Plane, Bike, Walk
- Energy: Electricity, Gas, Heating Oil, Renewable
- Diet: Meat (Beef/Other), Fish, Vegetarian, Vegan
- Consumption: Clothes, Electronics, Household, Recycled

#### Key Functions:
```clarity
(define-public (log-activity (activity-type uint) (activity-subtype uint) (amount uint)))
(define-read-only (get-user-carbon-total (user principal)))
(define-read-only (calculate-goal-progress (user principal)))
```

### Verification System

The verification system ensures the integrity of reported sustainable actions through multiple validation methods.

#### Verification Types:
- Self-attestation
- Photo/video evidence
- Community validation
- IoT device integration
- Third-party verification

#### Key Functions:
```clarity
(define-public (submit-activity (activity-type uint) (description (string-utf8 500))
               (verification-type uint) (evidence-hash (optional (buff 32)))))
(define-public (validate-activity (activity-id uint) (approved bool)
               (notes (optional (string-utf8 200)))))
```

### Eco Rewards

This contract manages the reward system, issuing tokens for verified sustainable actions and implementing engagement mechanisms.

#### Features:
- Token rewards based on action type and verification level
- Achievement badges (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum)
- Community challenges
- Token redemption options

#### Key Functions:
```clarity
(define-public (record-action (action-id (string-ascii 36)) (action-type uint)
               (verification-level uint)))
(define-public (create-challenge (name (string-ascii 50)) (description (string-ascii 200))
               (action-type uint) (required-count uint) (reward-amount uint) (duration uint)))
(define-public (redeem-tokens (option-id uint)))
```

## Getting Started

To interact with the EcoForge platform:

1. Register a user account using the `user-registry` contract
2. Start tracking carbon footprint by logging activities in the `carbon-tracker`
3. Submit activities for verification through the `verification-system`
4. Earn and manage rewards using the `eco-rewards` contract

## Future Enhancements

The platform is designed to support future expansions including:
- Community challenges and competitions
- Carbon offset marketplace integration
- External verification service partnerships
- Enhanced data analytics and reporting
- Mobile app integration

This project is actively developed and welcomes community contributions.
